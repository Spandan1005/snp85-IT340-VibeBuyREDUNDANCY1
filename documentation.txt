VibeBuy Project Documentation
This document provides a complete overview of the VibeBuy system architecture, explaining the role of each Virtual Machine (VM) and how to deploy the code to them.

Part 1: System Architecture & VM Roles
The VibeBuy application is distributed across 4 distinct Virtual Machines to simulate a real-world production environment with separation of concerns.

1. Frontend VM (Client)
IP Address: 100.77.215.88 (Currently hosted on the DevOps VM for testing)
Role: The "Face" of the application.
Function:
Hosts the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that run in the user's browser.
Displays the User Interface (Login, Register, Dashboard).
Sends requests (like "Log me in") to the Backend VM.
Does not talk directly to the database (for security).
2. Backend VM (Server)
IP Address: 100.105.55.118
Role: The "Brain" of the application.
Function:
Runs the Node.js/Express server (
server.js
).
Receives requests from the Frontend.
Performs logic: Hashing passwords, verifying MFA codes, validating email formats.
Talks to the Database VM to save or retrieve data.
3. Database VM (Storage)
IP Address: 100.81.244.102
Role: The "Memory" of the application.
Function:
Runs the MongoDB database server.
Stores all persistent data: User accounts, hashed passwords, MFA secrets.
Only accepts connections from the Backend VM.
4. DevOps VM (Management)
IP Address: 100.77.215.88
Role: The "Manager" / "Navigator".
Function:
Used for orchestration, documentation, and managing the other VMs.
In this specific setup, it is also doubling as the host for the Frontend files for ease of testing.
Part 2: Deployment Guide
Follow these steps to distribute the code and get the system running.

Step 1: Set up the Backend VM
Target: Backend VM (100.105.55.118)

Transfer Code: Copy the entire Backend_VM folder from your development machine to this VM.
Install Dependencies:
Open a terminal in the Backend_VM folder.
Run: npm install
Start Server:
Run: node server.js
You should see: Server running on port 5000 and MongoDB Connected.
Step 2: Set up the Database VM
Target: Database VM (100.81.244.102) - Windows

Install MongoDB:

Download and install "MongoDB Community Server" if not already installed.
Choose "Complete" setup and "Run as Network Service user".
Configure Network (Crucial Step):

By default, MongoDB only listens to itself (localhost). We need to change this so the Backend VM can talk to it.
Open Notepad as Administrator: Search for "Notepad", right-click it, and select "Run as administrator".
Open Config File: In Notepad, go to File > Open.
Navigate to: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\X.X\bin\ (replace X.X with your version, e.g., 6.0 or 7.0).
Change the file type dropdown from "Text Documents" to "All Files".
Select mongod.cfg and open it.
Edit bindIp:
Find the section that looks like this:
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
Change 127.0.0.1 to 0.0.0.0. It should look like this:
net:
  port: 27017
  bindIp: 0.0.0.0
Save: Save the file (Ctrl+S) and close Notepad.
Restart MongoDB Service:

Press Win + R, type services.msc, and hit Enter.
Find MongoDB Server in the list.
Right-click it and select Restart.
Note: If it fails to start, check your config file for typing errors (YAML is sensitive to spaces).
Step 3: Run the Frontend
Target: Your Current Machine / DevOps VM (100.77.215.88)

Locate Files: Go to the Frontend_VM folder.
Launch: Open 
LoginPage.html
 in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Test:
Try to Register a new account.
If successful, the Frontend (on your machine) talked to the Backend (on 100.105.55.118), which saved data to the Database (on 100.81.244.102).
Troubleshooting
"Network Error" or Nothing Happens:
Check if the Backend VM firewall allows traffic on port 5000.
Check if the Database VM firewall allows traffic on port 27017.
Ensure node server.js is actually running on the Backend VM.
"MongoDB Connection Error":
Check if bindIp is set to 0.0.0.0 on the Database VM.
Ensure the Backend VM can ping the Database VM IP.
